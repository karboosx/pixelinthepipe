# Pixel in the pipe
It's simple game where you create machines! There is 12 build-in levels. Or course you or someone else can create next one in editor and publish it.

# Level data

Basic schema of level data. Attribute **map** contain level data. You can generate it by **Editor**. 
```JSON
{
  "map": {
    "objects": [],
    "marks": [],
    "transporters": [],
    "pins": []
  },
  "name": "My first level",
  "money": -1,
  "objectives":[]
}
```
Attribute **money** set on -1 means infinity.

# Objectives
Basic objective:
```json
{
  "name": "Objective #1",
  "reword": 50,
  "needs": {
    "water": 1,
    "oil": 2
  }
}
```
This objective will be displaced as **Objective #1**. After collected 1 element od **water** and 2 elements of **oil**, player gain **50$**.

You can also change subname this objective by adding this attribute. It will be displaced above item list in objective.
```json
"itemsTitle":"Collect that items:"
```
If you wish to decrement collected item counter from time to time:
```json
"decTime":10
```
`1 unit = 100 ms`
`10 unit = 1 s `
etc.

If you want to fail level, at least one collector must be set in **restrict mode**.
To do that, change object in map:
```json
{
  "x": 9,
  "y": 18,
  "type": "storage",
  "data": {
    "item": "steam",
    "restrict": true
  }
}
```
This will make this storage accept only steam. If something else get in it, level will fail.

If you want storage accept only specific item, but not fail, set **restrict mode** to false.
Default value for restrict attribute is false.

## Additional attributes

  Tools allowed on this level. 
```json
"tools":["info","pipe"]
```

  Additional name. Great to describe level.
```json
"subname": "My awesome level"
```
        
  Items placed in cookbook. Also, this list of items will be used in filter.
```json
"cookbook":["info","pipe"]
```

  Animation will be displaced at beginning of level.
```json
"animation":[
  {"text": "Text #1"},
  {"text": "Text #2"},
]
```
You can also make own text on next button:
```json
  {"text": "Example text", "linkText":"Click me!"},
```

Difficulty level. Will be shown on level list.
```json
"difficult":"easy"
```
Available Difficulty: `supereasy`, `easy`, `medium`, `hard`.

List of items, which be generated by item generator.
```json
"itemsToGenerate": ["water","oil"]
```
Alternatively, you can specify custom items for single generator. To do that, you have to modify map attribute. Find in `map.objects` chosen generator, and change data attribute:
```json
{
  "x": 9,
  "y": 18,
  "type": "generator",
  "data": {"items":["water","oil"]}
}
```


Message displaced when objective fail.
```json
"failMessage":"Your objective fail"
```
